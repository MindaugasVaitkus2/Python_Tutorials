Remarks by President Obama and Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey before Bilateral Meeting



Waldorf Astoria Hotel
	New York, New York
4:46 P.M. EDT


PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well, I want to welcome Prime Minister Erdogan and his delegation to New York City and to the United States.  Turkey is a NATO ally, a great friend and partner on a whole host of issues.  I want to thank him for all the work that we’ve done together -- the cooperation in Afghanistan, the work that we most recently did in trying to provide freedom for Libya, and, in addition, the NATO obligations that both of us carry out together, most recently symbolized by the agreement of Turkey to host a missile defense radar.
Prime Minister Erdogan has shown great leadership on a range of issues and promoting democracy.  And we are very grateful to him for the work that we’ve done together. 
I do want to stress my deepest condolences for the loss of life through the explosion that took place in Ankara.  And I understand that the investigation is ongoing, but I think that this reminds us that terrorism exists in many parts of the world, and that Turkey and the United States are going to be strong partners in preventing terrorism.  And we look forward to working with you on these issues.
So, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for your service and thank you for your friendship.

PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Thank you very much, everybody.

PRESIDENT OBAMA:  We're starting the meeting now.
END
