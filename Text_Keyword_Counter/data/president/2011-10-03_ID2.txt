Statement from President Obama on the Submission of the Korea, Colombia, and Panama Trade Agreements



“The series of trade agreements I am submitting to Congress today will make it easier for American companies to sell their products in South Korea, Colombia, and Panama and provide a major boost to our exports.  These agreements will support tens of thousands of jobs across the country for workers making products stamped with three proud words: Made in America.  We've worked hard to strengthen these agreements to get the best possible deal for American workers and businesses, and I call on Congress to pass them without delay, along with the bipartisan agreement on Trade Adjustment Assistance that will help workers whose jobs have been affected by global competition.”
