Remarks by President Obama and Prime Minister Noda of Japan before Bilateral Meeting



United Nations
	New York, New York
12:20 P.M. EDT 


PRESIDENT OBAMA:  I want to welcome Prime Minister Noda and his delegation to New York City and to the United States.  As all of you are aware, we have an extraordinary alliance with Japan.  They are one of our closest friends, our closest allies.  We have worked cooperatively on a range of issues related to security, related to economics, and the bonds of friendship between our peoples is equally strong.
Prime Minister Noda and I have had the opportunity to speak by phone, although this is the first time that we've had a meeting face to face.  I know that he, like all of us, has some extraordinary challenges that we have to address.  And I know that at the top of his list is rebuilding Japan in the aftermath of the horrific tsunami that occurred.  I've repeatedly stressed that America will do everything that we can to make sure that that rebuilding is a success. 
At the same time, obviously, we have other important work to do together.  As the two largest economies in the world, we have to continue to promote growth that can help put our people to work and improve standards of living.  We have to modernize our alliance to meet the needs of the 21st century.  And so I’m looking forward to a very productive discussion, and what I’m sure will be an excellent working relationship with the Prime Minister, as well as his team.

PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Thank you, everybody.
