Statement by the President on Congressman Jerry Costello's Retirement




	“For over two decades, Jerry Costello has proudly represented the people of southwestern and southern Illinois. Born and raised in the state he now serves, Jerry has distinguished himself as a fierce advocate for improving our nation’s transportation infrastructure to ensure Illinois and the entire country are prepared to lead the way in a 21st century economy. Michelle and I want to join the people of Illinois in thanking Congressman Costello for his service, and we wish him and his family well in the future.”
