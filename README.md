Much of this code was written to supplement teaching in the [Computing for the Social Sciences](https://uc-cfss.github.io) course taught at the University of Chicago.

The web documentation and resources for much of the material can be found on this website, as well as my homepage [jmausolf.github.io/code](http://jmausolf.github.io/code).
