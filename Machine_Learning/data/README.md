# Data

Example data for this repository comes from the [General Social Survey (GSS) 2014](http://gss.norc.org/get-the-data/stata). We are examining a single year, but cumulative files are also available for data across years.

This data can be preprocessed in a number of ways. Since the data was in Stata formatting, I did some light preprocessing of the `.DTA` file. The original file and code to replicate this data preprocessing are located in [GSS_Source](/GSS_Source/).
